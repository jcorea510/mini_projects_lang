# rustygame

An simple minigame written in rust. It actually does nothing
but render to entities in a word. You can move one of the entities
and the other one chase you.

The main interest of this project is the floor planning: 
structures to hold entities, identification of entities,
resource manager, etc.

The code has a lot of flaws, but that the good thing!!.
